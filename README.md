## Why this repo?

This repository contains all my work from [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course and beyond.

In the past, I explored multiple paths in Data but realized I liked doing web development. Now, I'm focusing fully on learning **full-stack web development** and building real projects.

## Progress

- ‚úÖ **Started The Odin Project Foundations Course**
