# WEEK 1
**NOTE**: I try to write as much as I can in markdown here, then I use CGPT to fix it using prompt "I have some notes for a course I'm taking. Can you help improve the structure and grammar while keeping the content the same? Please provide the edited notes in a .md (Markdown) format and share a link to download the file". These thoughts.md files are for me to recall content and add details/references in future.

# C Programming Notes

## Compilation Process
- **Source Code** → **Compiler** → **Machine Code**
  - Source Code: The code we write.
  - Compiler: A translator that converts source code into machine code.
  - Machine Code: The language the computer understands.

## First Code Run on cs50.dev
- Ran the first code in `cs50.dev` (an online VSCode IDE for CS50).
- Used:
  - `code hello.c`: To create the `.c` file.
  - `make hello`: To compile `hello.c`.
  - `./hello`: To run the executable file generated by `make`. (`./hello` is similar to double-clicking an app in Windows/Mac).

## Arguments → Function → Side Effects (Return Value)

### Understanding the First Line of Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

**Q: Why is it written like this? What does it mean?**
- A: This is the syntax of C, which you'll get used to. Every programming language has its own syntax.
- This line declares to the compiler that we want to include the following `.h` file (a header file) during compilation.
  - The header file is part of a library written by others that we can use without needing to understand its internal workings. For example, by including `stdio.h`, we can use standard input/output functions like `printf`.

Note: Header files specify the inputs and outputs of functions, while the actual implementation is in other files within the library.

## Documentation (Manual Pages)
- We learned about accessing **Manual Pages** to understand libraries and their usage.
- Header files define the available functions in a particular library.

## Variables
- **Variables** are containers that store values and allow us to give those values a name. The value can change over time (hence "variable").
- **Initialization**: Variables need to be declared with a data type (i.e., what type of value they store) and then assigned a value using the `=` operator.
  
  Example:
  ```c
  float pi, sqrt2, sqrt3; // Declaration
  pi = 3.14; // Assignment
  char letter = 'H'; // Initialization
  ```

- Good practice: Only declare variables when you need them.

## Basic Datatypes in C
- **bool**, **char**, **string**, **int**, **long**, **float**, **double**.
  - Note: `bool` and `string` aren't natively available in C. We need to include `cs50.h` in our program to use them. These will only compile in `cs50.dev` and cannot run locally.

- **Format Specifiers**: `%c`, `%s`, `%i`, `%li`, `%f`, `%lf`.
  - Used as placeholders in `printf` to format output.

### int and unsigned int
- **int**: Takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory, ranging from approximately -2 billion to +2 billion.
- **unsigned int**: Doubles the positive range (up to ~4 billion), but disallows negative values.
- try to store -1 in a unsigned int and print it. Output is -1 using get_int from cs50 lib (find reason)

**Note**: `unsigned` is a qualifer that can be applied to certain types (including `int`). There are other qualifers like `short`, `long`, and `const` etc.

**NOTE**: its commonplace to capitalize a variable, if its a constant (eg. `const int N;`)

### char
- Used for storing a single character.
- Takes 1 byte of memory (8 bits), limiting the range of values.
  
### float
- Used for floating-point (real) numbers.
- Takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory.
- Floats have precision issues due to the limited number of bits.

### double
- Solves the precision problem of `float` to some extent.
- Double-precision (64 bits or 8 bytes).

### void
- Not a datatype, but a **type** used in functions.
  - If a function has `void` as its return type, it doesn't return a value.
  - If a function takes `void` as a parameter, it doesn't accept any arguments.

**Note**: Research "truncation error" in C, where a return value should be a floating-point number, but the decimal portion is removed.

## Arithmetic Operators
- **Addition** (`+`), **Subtraction** (`-`), **Multiplication** (`*`), **Division** (`/`), and **Modulus** (`%`).
  - Modulus gives the remainder when the left-hand number is divided by the right-hand number.

## Boolean Expressions
- Used for comparing values.
  - They evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

### Two Types of Boolean Expressions:
1. **Logical Operators**:
   - AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`).
2. **Relational Operators**:
   - Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`), Greater or equal (`>=`), Less or equal (`<=`), Equality (`==`), Inequality (`!=`).

**Note**: `=` is the assignment operator and `==` checks for equality between two values.

## Functions
- syntax:
  ```c
  return-type func_name(argument-list);
  ```
- also known as procedures, methods, and subroutines.
- argument(s) --> function --> return value(s)
- used for (better) organization, simplification, and reusability.
- an prototype of the function can be declared before the main function.  You can then define the fuction after main function -this way the main function remains on the top.
- See examples in the "code_along" section.

### Understanding the main function
```c
int main (void){
  // will complete this section later
}
```

## In-Scope Variables
- the context in which the variables exists.
- it is a characteristics of a variable that defines from which functions that variable may be accesses.
  - local variables: can only be accessed within the functions in which they are created.
  - global variables: can be accesses by any function in the program.
- Most variables in C are **passed by values** in function calls, which is a method for passing arguments to functions that copies the value of the argument into the function's local parameter variables.
  - The original variable passed to the function cannot be modified by the function. 
  - The changes made to the parameter are only within the scope of the called function. 
  - The changes do not affect the value of the argument in the calling function.

## Conditionals
- `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements.
  - See examples in the "code_along" section for differences.

## Loops
- `while`, `for`, and `do-while` were introduced.
  - See examples in the "code_along" section for differences.

## Problems with C (with some solutions)
- Integer Overflow.
- Truncation
  - Its solution is type casting (treating one type as another type)
- Floating point imprecision

## Command line
- some linux shell commands include `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rmdir` etc.
