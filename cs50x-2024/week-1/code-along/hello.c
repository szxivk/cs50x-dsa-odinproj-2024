 * .h files are known as header files,  it provides the necessary information for the compiler to understand how to use
   the functions and variables defined in the corresponding source or library files.
   eg. stdio.h includes standard functions like "printf", which we can call (use) after including it in our code.
 * int main(void){} for now consider it the main function which runs the code inside its curly brackets{} when a code is executed.
