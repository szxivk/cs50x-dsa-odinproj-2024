- **Computers and Binary**: Computers only understand **0s and 1s** (representing **on & off**, **yes & no**, or **true & false**). 
    - **INPUT** ----> **ALGORITHM** ----> **OUTPUT**
- **Number Systems**: Learned about **base 2** (binary), **base 10** (decimal), and **base 16** (hexadecimal).
  - **1 byte** = 8 bits (a "bit" can be either 0 or 1). For example, `00000001` in binary (base 2) equals **1** in decimal (base 10), using up 1 byte.
  
- **ASCII vs. Unicode**:
  - The **ASCII** table contains **128 characters**, with values ranging from 0 to 127. Therefore, **7 bits** are sufficient to represent a character in ASCII; however, most systems reserve **1 byte (8 bits)** for each ASCII character.
  - **Unicode** expands on this:
    - **UTF-8** uses 1 byte per character.
    - **UTF-16** uses 2 bytes per character.
    - **UTF-32** uses 4 bytes per character.
    - Unicode uses **hexidecimal** number system.
    - Unicode can encode over **1,000,000 characters** using its extension mechanism. 

- **RGB Color System**: 
  - The **RGB system** uses **24 bits** to represent colors, where each pixel is a combination of three primary colors: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**.
  - Each color component (R, G, or B) is assigned **8 bits**, which means it can have a value between **0 and 255** (2^8 = 256 possible values).
  - The combination of these three numbers determines the final color of the pixel. For example:
    - **(255, 0, 0)** represents **pure red** (maximum red, no green, no blue).
    - **(0, 255, 0)** represents **pure green**.
    - **(0, 0, 255)** represents **pure blue**.
    - **(255, 255, 255)** represents **white**, as all three components are at their maximum values.
    - **(0, 0, 0)** represents **black**, with all components at their lowest value.
  - By adjusting the values of red, green, and blue, any color can be created using these **24 bits**.
  
- **Interpreting Numbers**: All communication with computers happens through **numbers**, so **context** is essential.
  - For example, in an email program, numbers are interpreted as **alphabets (characters)** using **ASCII** or **Unicode**. The number **72** in ASCII represents the letter **'H'** and **U+0048** in **UNICODE**
  - In graphics programs, we interpret numbers as **colors** .

- learned about writing **Pseudocode** -> control flow

- Learned about **Scratch** to visualize code structure and logic.
