user: i wrote " int s = get_int("size of arr: ");
    int arr[s];
    arr[0] = 1;" after i got an for " int s = get_int("size of arr: ");
    int arr[s] = {1};"

can you explain why this happened to me

assistant: It looks like you're trying to initialize an array with a dynamic size. In C, you can't use dynamic arrays with an initializer list like `{1}`. Instead, you need to initialize the elements individually after declaring the array.

Your first approach:
```c
int s = get_int("size of arr: ");
int arr[s];
arr[0] = 1;
```
is correct for setting the first element to 1. 

Can you show me the exact error message you received?

user: doubling.c:7:13: error: variable-sized object may not be initialized
    7 |     int arr[s] ={1};

make: *** [<builtin>: doubling] Error 1

assistant: The error message indicates that you cannot initialize a variable-sized array with an initializer list. Instead, you should initialize the elements individually after declaring the array, like this:

```c
int s = get_int("size of arr: ");
int arr[s];
arr[0] = 1;
```

This way, you avoid the error and correctly set the first element of the array.

user: ok

assistant: Got it! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
