- Symbols in Flowcharts:

    - Start/End (Oval): Used at the beginning or end of the flowchart.
    - Process (Rectangle): Represents any action or operation in the flow.
    - Decision (Diamond): Shows a branching point with conditions like Yes/No or True/False.
    - Input/Output (Rhombus): Used for receiving input or displaying output.
    - Arrow (---->): Directs the flow from one step to the next.
